# No longer a c1own?

I have moved my homepage to [`crossorigin.net`](https://crossorigin.net). Existing links should work if you replace the domain name from `c1own.com` to `crossorigin.net`, but if it doesn't please reach out to me via [email](https://crossorigin.net/my-email/). Sorry about the inconvenience. -SM
